/**
 An example demonstrating a Siri-style, privacy-focused domain routing scenario.

    This example uses a CoreML model to classify user prompts into three domains:
    - Private: Prompts that should be handled locally on the device.
    - Public: Prompts that can be sent to a server for processing.
    - Unsure: Prompts that are ambiguous and should be handled locally.

    The example includes a set of test cases to evaluate the model's performance.
    The model is expected to classify prompts correctly based on their context.

    This example aims for 100% accuracy in domain classification, for user safety.
