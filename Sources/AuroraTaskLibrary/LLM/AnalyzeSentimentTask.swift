/**
 `AnalyzeSentimentTask` analyzes the sentiment of a list of strings using an LLM service.

 - **Inputs**
    - `strings`: The list of strings to analyze.
    - `detailed`: Boolean indicating whether to return detailed sentiment analysis. Defaults to `false`.
 - **Outputs**
    - `sentiments`: A dictionary where keys are the input strings and values are their respective sentiments.

 ### Use Cases:
 - Understand the emotional tone of user feedback, social media posts, or reviews.
 - Categorize content into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment for analytics or moderation.
 - Identify emotional trends over time in a dataset.

 ### Example:
 **Input Strings**
 - "I love this product!"
 - "The service was okay."
 - "I’m very disappointed with the quality."

 **Output JSON:**
 ```
 {
   "sentiments": {
     "I love this product!": "Positive",
     "The service was okay.": "Neutral",
     "I’m very disappointed with the quality.": "Negative"
   }
 }
 ```

 **Output JSON with detailed analysis:**
 ```
 {
   "sentiments": {
     "I love this product!": {"sentiment": "Positive", "confidence": 95},
     "The service was okay.": {"sentiment": "Neutral", "confidence": 70},
     "I’m very disappointed with the quality.": {"sentiment": "Negative", "confidence": 90}
   }
 }
 ```

            3. Ensure the JSON object is properly formatted and valid.

            5. Do not include anything else, like markdown notation around it or any extraneous characters. The ONLY thing you should return is properly formatted, valid JSON and absolutely nothing else.
